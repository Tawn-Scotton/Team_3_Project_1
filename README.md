Our team used a csv that we pulled from the Department of Transportation about FLight Arrival Delays.
We cleaned and analyzed the data.
Our inital hypothesis was about the effect of weather on flight delays.
U
pon sorting and grouping the data using pandas, we realized that of the listed reasons, weather was the smallest reason.  We learned the different definitions and acronyms used in talking about delays, cancellations and diversions. 

The time period studied was from 2003 to 2022. We started with all airlines and then scoped down to the top 5 airlines and the last 5 years.
